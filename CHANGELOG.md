# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may change behavior).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--delimiter CHAR` for semicolon, tab, pipe or any single-character separator, with the aliases `tab`, `comma`, `semicolon` and `pipe` (#1).
- `--decimal-comma` to infer floats written as `10,5` (#2, #5).
- `--delimiter auto`: deterministic detection among `,` `;` tab and `|` that stops with exit code 7 instead of guessing when the file is ambiguous (#3, #6).
- JSON output: `delimiter` and `delimiter_detected` fields. Markdown output names the delimiter when it is not the default comma.
- `reader.open_rows()` and `profile.profile_file()` for streaming use from Python.
- ADR 0002 documenting the streaming design.
- `min`/`max` for `date` columns, as ISO strings (#11).
- `datetime` type for strict ISO 8601 date-times, with a range that compares offsets as instants and is omitted when offset-aware and local values are mixed (#10).
- `--na TOKENS` to count values such as `NA`, `null` or `s/d` as missing, at no per-row cost; JSON gains `na_tokens` (#9).
- `scripts/update_readme_samples.py` regenerates the README samples from real runs.
- CI measures line and branch coverage (subprocess CLI runs included) and requires 100%; new tests cover malformed CSV (field over the `csv` size limit) and encoding errors with `--delimiter auto`.

### Changed

- Files are profiled in a single streaming pass instead of being loaded into memory: on a 1,000,000-row file, peak memory dropped from 873 MB to 234 MB and time from 6.85 s to 4.92 s, with identical output (#4).
- Errors are reported in the order they occur in the file; with `--max-rows`, the part of the file after the limit is not read.

### Fixed

- The offset of an invalid UTF-8 byte is now counted from the start of the file; with a BOM it used to be three bytes too low.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial version: per-column type inference, missing values, distinct counts, min/max and top values, duplicate rows, Markdown and JSON output.
